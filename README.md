# Flutter-Weather-App
  Flutter Weather App is an amazing app developed with Flutter, The Ui is properly arranged, and responsive. I totally intend to make this app fully functional working app, but for now this app is simply ui based app.


## Features (some features will be implemented on next versions)

- Weather forecast with city search,
- rain alert (feature to alert user if rainy day tommorrow),
- Muslims prayer times with current city,
- prayer reminder (reminds when prayer time starts)
- Uni page simple ui
